Combo: Saturday, shopping and rain 🌧️.

Curiosity: 
1) Honeybees can recognize human faces.
​Even though their brains are about the size of a sesame seed, honeybees use a method similar to humans to remember faces. They take individual parts of a face—like the eyes, nose, and mouth—and combine them into a single pattern. 🐝

​In experiments, researchers showed bees photos of people. When the bees chose a specific face, they were rewarded with sugar water. Later, even without the reward, the bees consistently chose the correct face out of a group of photos.

2) The Immortal Jellyfish 🪼
​There is a species of jellyfish that can live forever.
​The Turritopsis dohrnii, also known as the "Immortal Jellyfish," has a unique way of cheating death. When it becomes sick, injured, or simply grows old, it doesn't die. Instead, it undergoes a process called transdifferentiation.
​Essentially, the jellyfish transforms its cells back into their earliest state and reverts into a "polyp"—which is like a baby version of itself. It then starts its life cycle all over again. In theory, this process can go on indefinitely, making the jellyfish biologically immortal!
