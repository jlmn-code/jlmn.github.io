Combo: Saturday, shopping and rain 🌧️.

Curiosity.

Honeybees can recognize human faces.
​Even though their brains are about the size of a sesame seed, honeybees use a method similar to humans to remember faces. They take individual parts of a face—like the eyes, nose, and mouth—and combine them into a single pattern. 🐝

​In experiments, researchers showed bees photos of people. When the bees chose a specific face, they were rewarded with sugar water. Later, even without the reward, the bees consistently chose the correct face out of a group of photos.
